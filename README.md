HTML and JavaScript structure for the Nike store looks comprehensive and includes various features like sliders, product options, a cart system, and animations. Here are a few suggestions to enhance functionality and clean up the code:

CSS Styling Tweaks:

Ensure the cart icon is aligned consistently by adding styles for different screen sizes in style.css.
Use display: none for the payment section initially and only show it when the "BUY NOW!" button is clicked.
For a subtle font choice, keep Lato or consider Google Fonts like "Poppins" or "Montserrat", which offer a clean, modern look.
JavaScript Optimization:

Event Listeners: Rather than re-selecting elements each time, move common selections (like cartCount, cartPopup) outside function scopes for better performance.
Color Selection Logic: Add a check in the currentProductColors.forEach loop to handle cases where a product has fewer than two colors.
Responsive Design:

Test the navigation, sliders, and cart pop-up on mobile devices to ensure they adjust seamlessly. Consider hiding the cart pop-up or moving it to the bottom of the screen on smaller screens for accessibility.
Accessibility:

Add aria-label attributes to important interactive elements like the cart icon, close buttons, and product buttons.
Use role="button" for div elements acting as buttons for better screen reader support.
